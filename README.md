# -Arduino-Simple-Tasks-with-Different-Schedulers

This was a project for "Intro to Embedded Systems" course at University of Washington, Seattle. The purpose of the lab was to perform some simple tasks on different scheduler algorithms.

Required tasks:
Task 1: Flash an external LED for 250ms every 1 second.
Task 2: Play a theme and sleep for 4 sec, then play again.
Task 3: 7 seg disp count up by 1 unit every 100ms.
Task 4: Play theme and display freq value at the same time. Pause for 4s and display countdown on 7 seg. Repeat.
Task 5: Count time on 4 digit 7 seg display in seconds.
(Task Smile: design a smiley face on 7-seg for extra points)

Scheduler algorithms:
1. Simple round robin (RR)
2. Syncronized round robin (SRRI)
3. Data description specifications (DDS)

Performed on Elegoo Mega2560 board
